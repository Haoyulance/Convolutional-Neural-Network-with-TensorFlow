# Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow
Some realization and convolutional layer visualization of CNN by TensorFlow
## Problem1
some basic Neural Network structure realizations. 
• Constructed fully connected layer, convolutional layer, dropout layer, activation layer and connected different networks with forward pass and backpropagation to test accuracy. 
• Constructed different optimizers, such as SGD, SGD+Momentum, RMSProp, Adam and compared different optimizers by performance.

## Problem2
Design Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow
