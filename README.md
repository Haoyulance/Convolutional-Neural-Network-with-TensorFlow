# Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow
Some realization and convolutional layer visualization of CNN by TensorFlow
## Problem1
some basic Neural Network structures realized by self designed classes. 

• Constructed fully connected layer, convolutional layer, dropout layer, activation layer, cross-entropy loss and built different networks with forward pass and backpropagation to test accuracy. 

• Constructed different optimizers, such as SGD, SGD+Momentum, RMSProp, Adam and compared different optimizers by performance.

## Problem2
Designing Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow

• Designed CNN network by TensorFlow to get 0.75 accuracy on test set used CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Problem3
Training, Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning on Fashion MNIST and MNIST

• Pre-trained CNN model on large dataset, then realized fine tuning and tranfer learning on another similar small dataset with new labels to prevent overfitting and improve accuracy on test set. 

## Problem4
Visalizations and CAM

• Visualized learning filters with VGG16 model. 

• Visualized activations with self designed model with CIFAR-10 dataset. 

• Visualized convolutional layer output of VGG16 model by Grad-CAM technology with top5 label prediction output.
